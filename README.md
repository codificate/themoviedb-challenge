### Goal
The goal of this exercise is to let you show your programming skills in Android. The  
specifications of this exercise are quite relaxed.  
You need to implement an app that:

### Minimum requirements

* reads a JSON feed from the Internet  
* parses it and shows their contents in a list  
* persists the contents of the feed locally, so if the app is used without Internet connection it will show previously downloaded content.

Which information you should show for each item in the list will depend on the feed you  choose. It's up to you!. If it contains images, please show them, as we want to see the code   for fetching and displaying them or how you use a 3rd party library to do it.

### Extra requirements
Once that is done, you could extend it depending on how long you would like to spend on it. If   you came up with something cool that you would like to show, feel free to code it. If you run  out of ideas, these are points that we will value:

* a detailed view for each item in the list.  
* an app that takes into account the fragmentation issue in Android (i.e.: adapting itself to different screen sizes, using compatibility code...)  
* a version for tablets in where the list of items and the detailed view are shown in the same screen  
* Performance and optimizations that provide a smooth scrolling experience.   Things that we positively value  
* clarity, elegancy, and maintainability of code  
* use of third party libraries to deal with common patterns: dependency injection, network requests, json parsing, image caching  
* demonstration of knowledge of the Android design guidelines  
* demonstration of knowledge of how to deal with different devices and the fragmentation issue in Android  
* Idiomatic and functional code style is encouraged
